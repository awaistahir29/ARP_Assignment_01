This is the first assignment of Advanced Robot Programming which has been done by the Robotics Engineering students by designing and developing the hoist in which the two consoles are allowing the user to activate and control the robot. 

There are two motors.
MotorX, MotorZ 
These motors are moving the along to axis to move the object vertical and horizontal axis.

The movement is bound from 0 to a maximum value of distance, which is set to 1, for each motor. 

In the project there are 6 processes: 

1) starter
2) commandConsole
3) inspectionConsole
4) motorX 
5) motorZ 
6) watchdog 

From the user side the commandConsole and the inspectionConsole acts as an interface to respectively manage the movement and other commands and to view the current position on the axis and to stop or reset the hoist position.

The communication between the processes was managed through the use of pipes, that allow to write or read from a process to another one
through a one to one connection.

The concept of signals used for the functionalities of inspespection console to emergency stop and reset which is managed by the interrupt.
